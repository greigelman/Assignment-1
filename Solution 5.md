Forking a repository is a copy of that
repository that you may work on without
changing the original. You would fork a
repository when you would want to work on a
copy without changing the original. The
workflow for forking would be to have an
original document that allows multiple
people to work off without changing the
original version but still allows them to
have a version of their own. An example of
this would be cloning the class repository
in order to have my own version in order to
work on it without having to worry about
messing with the original.
